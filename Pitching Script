# Let us show you how you can view a dataset

View(Pitching_File)


# We will start this off with the basics tools when you first get a dataset. 

summary(Pitching_File)

# Here is a basic summary with the different quartiles and such for column. 
# This is helpful for seeing an overview of the statistics. 

dim(Pitching_File)

# This means 5109 entries and 30 columns. dim() is a function used for dimension. 

# Here, we can clearly see the datatypes for each variable. 
# We will show you later down this quarter as for how to change the datatype for these columns.

str(Pitching_File)

# To look at first couple of rows of the dataset, we can use the head() function 

head(Pitching_File, 10)

# To do the opposite, meaning to look at the bottom rows of the dataset, we can use the tail() function:

tail(Pitching_File, 10)

# Now we will import a library called dplyr to conduct more analysis upon our data, such as basic plotting. 

library(dplyr)

# Here, we used the arrange function to order the losses in increasing order. 

Pitching_File_2 <- arrange(Pitching_File, L)
View(Pitching_File_2)

# For decreasing order, you can do this:

Pitching_File_2 <-arrange(Pitching_File, desc(ERA))
View(Pitching_File_2)

# Now, the dataset has been placed in decreasing order.

## Graphs


subsetted_data<-head(Pitching_File,20)
counts_1<- table(subsetted_data$yearID)
barplot(counts_1, main='Years which players played',
        xlab='years', ylab='Amount of players',col=c('blue','red'))
# This graph is a perfect representation of the amount of players which played per year. 

View(subsetted_data)

# Here is an example of barplot:

table(subsetted_data$BB) %>% barplot(col= 'blue', xlab= 'Amount of walks', 
ylab= 'frequency', main = 'Amount of walks by pitchers in subsetted data')

#This graph is a perfect representation of the amount of players which played per year.  
 
library(corrplot)       

baseball_matrix<- as.matrix(subsetted_data[ , c(16:17)])
par(ask=TRUE)
corrplot(baseball_matrix,method='circle',is.corr = FALSE)

#Corrplot takes too much time to load so i will fix this later

plot(subsetted_data$H,subsetted_data$HR)

# There is zero correlation with a player's amount of hits to the amount of home runs they hit. 
# This is important since hits can be in any form such as singles, doubles or triples.


subsetted_data_2<- head(subsetted_data,4)
slices<- subsetted_data_2$H
l<- subsetted_data_2$teamID
percent<- round(slices/sum(slices)*100)
l<- paste(l,percent)
l<-paste(l,'%',sep='')
pie(slices,labels=l, main='pie chart of homeruns per team in 1884')


#Here is a small pie chart for home runs per team in 1884.

library(plotrix)
pie3D(slices,labels=l, main='pie chart of homeruns per team in 1884',explode= 0.4)

#Explode helps separate the different slices of pie into different parts. 


hist(subsetted_data$SO, col='blue', breaks=100)
rug(subsetted_data$SO)

# Most of the strikeouts in the dataset were in the range 0-5. 


# Here is another histogram, 
# but we will add a abline to the center of the graph to see the data's distribution. 

hist(subsetted_data$SO, col='green')
abline(v=15, lwd=5)
abline(v=median(subsetted_data$S0),col='red', lwd=10)



boxplot(subsetted_data$ERA, col='red')
abline(h=5)

# There is a good amount of data values which are placed outside of the box and whisker. 
# This means that there might be about 3 possible outliers. 

## GGPLOT
# Now we have seen many basic plotting functions in R. 
# Let us explore another package, ggplot2, to see how this will work out.

library(ggplot2)
View(Pitching_File)
View(subsetted_data)

ggplot(subsetted_data, aes(x=BB, y=H))+
geom_point()

# Here is just an example of gg plot being utilized to show the correlation between the walks and hits. 
# There is a clear positive correlation in this dataset. 

ggplot(subsetted_data, aes(x=H))+
geom_density()

# In this graph, we can clearly see that the density graph is skewed but has a clear drop at the end of the graph. 

ggplot(subsetted_data, aes(x=IPouts, y=ER))+
geom_line()

# Here we can see that the higher amount of Innings per out pitched, 
# means that there is a higher amount of Earned Runs (ER) from the pitcher.
